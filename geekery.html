                            <h3>The core of your life is your purpose</h3>
                            <p>The core of your life is your purpose. Everything else in your life, from your diet to your career, must be aligned with your purpose, if you are to act with coherence and integrity in the world. If you know your purpose, your deepest desire, than the secret of success is to discipline your life, so that you support your deepest purpose and minimize distractions and detours.</br>David Derida</p>

								<h3>The site.</h3>
								<p>This domain once hosted a training ground and side project of my first web job. And of course was build with Drupal7.
								</br>For this version I decided to go for something a little bit more conventional.
								</br>Also the goal itself has changed over the years. At the moment this should act as a plattform to link my different projects. Such that you could get a short impression of what I did, do or maybe can do for you.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="6u 12u(mobilep)">
								<h3>The Agenda</h3>
								<p>A site dedicated To Obvious Doings. Of course the slogan is an acronym of my name. Nonetheless it is the core idea ever since I registered to domain. Be it design or different projects. It is all about to:
								</br>"Be the change you want to see in this world"- Ghandi.</br>
								</br>If you find my engagements interesting, you have questions or want to connect, leave me a note.</p>
